# A Shiny app for visualizing MAF files
[Mutation Annotation Format (MAF)](https://docs.gdc.cancer.gov/Encyclopedia/pages/Mutation_Annotation_Format/) files are used for storing somatic mutation data across cohorts. For example, [The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)](https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga) project has made MAF files from each project publicly available.  This app is intended to help allow quick summarization and visualization of these kind of data.

## Features:
- Download publicly available mutation data from TCGA on-the-fly
- Select sample information to show as annotations
- Make plots
  - Mutational Burden
  - Oncoplot
  - Mutational Signatures (COSMIC v3.1)
  - Output data as simplified table
